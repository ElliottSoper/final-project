						<div class="modal-content" id="modal-content-corn">
							<h2>Corn</h2>
							<h3>Ingredients</h3>
							<p>1/2 cup olive oil</p>
							<p>2 garlic cloves, chopped</p>
							<p>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan</p>
							<p>2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves</p>
							<p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
							<p>6 ears yellow corn, husked, halved crosswise</p>
							<h3>Directions</h3>
							<p>Heat the oil in a heavy small skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and saute until tender and fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove the skillet from the heat and cool. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese and stir the rest into the garlic mixture, along with the parsley and salt. Cook the corn in a large saucepan of boiling salted water until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the corn to a platter. Brush the cheese mixture over the hot corn and serve. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons of cheese on top of the corn.</p>

						<div class="modal-content" id="modal-content-hummus">
							<h2>Hummus</h2>
							<h3>Ingredients</h3>
							<p>2 cups drained well-cooked or canned chickpeas, liquid reserved</p>
							<p>1/2 cup tahini (sesame paste), optional, with some of its oil</p>
							<p>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus oil for drizzling</p>
							<p>2 cloves garlic, peeled, or to taste</p>
							<p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>
							<p>1 tablespoon ground cumin or paprika, or to taste, plus a sprinkling for garnish</p>
							<p>Juice of 1 lemon, plus more as needed</p>
							<p>Chopped fresh parsley leaves for garnish</p>
							<h3>Directions</h3>
							<p>Put everything except the parsley in a food processor and begin to process; add the chickpea liquid or water as needed to allow the machine to produce a smooth puree. Taste and adjust the seasoning (I often find I like to add much more lemon juice). Serve, drizzled with the olive oil and sprinkled with a bit more cumin or paprika and some parsley.</p>

							<h2>Feta Turkey Burger</h2>
							<h3>Ingredients</h3>
							<p>4 pearl tomatoes, sliced in half & squeezed</p>
							<p>2 cloves garlic, chopped</p>
							<p>1/2 medium red onion, chopped</p>
							<p>1 lb ground turkey</p>
							<p>4 oz feta cheese, chopped</p>
							<p>1 large egg</p>
							<p>1/3 cup bread crumb (or oats)</p>
							<p>1 tbs olive oil</p>
							<p>sea salt & ground pepper to taste</p>
							<h3>Directions</h3>
							<p>In a food processor, chop the tomatoes, garlic, onion and basil. In a large bowl, using a rubber spatula, gently combine all of the ingredients (tomato mixture with everything else). Go light on the salt since the feta compliments this dish so well. Form your patties and place them on wax or parchment paper.  Remember, they do shrink a bit, so don't form them too small. Heat a grill pan on medium high heat.  When pan is hot, add the patties. Reduce heat to medium low or low, and cook about 5 minutes on each side (more if they are thick).   </p>

							<h2>Chocolate Mousse</h2>
							<h3>Ingredients</h3>
							<p>2 cups chilled heavy cream</p>
							<p>4 large egg yolks</p>
							<p>3 tablespoons sugar</p>
							<p>1 teaspoon vanilla</p>

Whisk together yolks, sugar, and a pinch of salt in a metal bowl until combined well, then add hot cream in a slow stream, whisking until combined. Transfer mixture to saucepan and cook over moderately low heat, stirring constantly, until it registers 160°F on thermometer. Pour custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and stir in vanilla.
